        <h1><span class="badge badge-dark">Why i want to be an Software Developer!</span></h1>
        <p>As far back i can remember I have always found an big interest in technology and the world of computers. A love the star wars movies and are still a big fan. In the age of around 10 years old i got my hands on my first ever computer. I install some DOS program and played with just because it was fun. When I was around 14 years old I started writing some small html sites, and played alot with the Adobe flash animations. When highschool was over I started the same education, that I am taking now. I made it through the first 40 weeks and did it very well, but I could not find any internship. So i drop out and began to work insted. And now 20 years later I am finally following my dream!</p>

My application collect that data, one supplier with FTP connection, and one with direct download link. Then I convert the data from .xml, .xls, .dat, .xml, to a new xml-file(design by my and our team), then uploads it to our own FTP-server.

            <p class="card-text">It was heard gettin started, but my first thing to do was to cleanup the premade code, take it apart and seperate it in to section. Then make the navbar/menu work with the correct links. After that I tryed to redesign the links to be centered. I couldent find the right css property at that moment, so i skipped that part at the time!</p>

Made my own style.css file to add to the project and made an selector for the top/home section an added the wallpaper.
